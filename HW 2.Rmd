knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

First I will read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

*   specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read_excel
*   use reasonable variable names
*   omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
*   round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

```{r}
trash_wheel = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheel.xlsx") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
trash_wheel
```
